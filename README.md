# Malware_Analysis_Workshop
This repo is where I will keep all my projects done during the GDSC-delta Malware Analysis workshop

## Task 1: Keylogger using socket programming in Python.
The first part of this task was about creating a simple keylogger that detects keystrokes done by the victim and sends them over a socket to the developer.
Some added functionalities:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- System information capture\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- Clipboard information capture\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3- Screenshot of the victim's device\

The second part of this task involved creating a signature detector or virus fingerprint that used hashes to determine whether an executable is malicious or not.

## Task 2: Summary for an article discussing basic architeture.
