# Malware_Analysis_Workshop
This repo is where I will keep all my projects done during the GDSC-delta Malware Analysis workshop

## Task 1: Keylogger using socket programming in Python
This task was about creating a simple keylogger that detects keystrokes done by the victim and sends them over a socket to the developer.
Some added functionalities:\
        1- System information capture\
        2- Clipboard information capture\
        3- Screenshot of the victim's device\
